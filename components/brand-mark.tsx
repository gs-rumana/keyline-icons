/**
 * The site's logo mark: four shapes, one per collection, the diamond in sharp,
 * the triangle in stroke, the circle in duotone and the square in fill,
 * painted in keyline blue with nothing behind it. The geometry and why it is
 * shaped this way live in `lib/brand-mark.ts`.
 *
 * Inlined rather than loaded from `public/logo/logo.svg`: it renders in the nav
 * on every page, and a request plus a paint-in for something that small is
 * worse than the markup. `next/image` does not optimise SVG anyway, and a bare
 * `<img>` trips the repo's lint.
 *
 * Size it with `className`; there is deliberately no `width`/`height` here.
 * The viewBox is the ink box, so `size-6` is 24px of shapes.
 *
 * The colour is set once, as `color` on the root, and every path paints
 * `currentColor`. It reads a custom property that falls back to the token: on
 * a `--primary` surface (the design-files button) a blue mark is blue on blue,
 * so that parent sets `--brand-mark-ink` to `--primary-foreground`, with
 * nothing threaded through the components in between. Custom properties
 * inherit into a nested `<svg>`, and an inline declaration beats every class
 * rule, which a Tailwind utility here would not. Always a token, never a
 * literal, so the mark still follows the theme.
