// Check the paper.design files against previews/paper/.
//
// Files, plural, since 11 Sep 2026: Paper's ceiling is on a whole file, so the
// set is split across two of them by `SET_PAPER_FILES` in lib/site-chrome.ts.
// Every board is looked for in both and then judged on whether it turned up in
// the one it belongs in, which is the STRAY finding.
//
//   node pipeline/check-paper.mjs [--file <id>] [--json]
//
// `paper:check` proves the sheets on disk match `icons/`. It says nothing about
// the file those sheets were written into, and that gap is where the drift
// actually lives: an artboard is written once and then sits there while the set
// moves underneath it. A board of 48 icons against a sheet of 51 looks exactly
// like a board that is up to date.
//
// This is the Paper half of what `check-figma.mjs` does for Figma, and it is
// cheaper: Paper's MCP server is local HTTP with no auth, so this talks to it
// directly rather than emitting a snippet for someone to paste through a plugin
// console. It needs Paper Desktop open with the file in it, which is why it is
// not in `icons:ci` — the same reason `icons:figma` and `brand:check` sit out.
//
// **What it compares, and what it cannot.** Paper will not hand geometry back:
// `get_jsx` returns the layout with the drawings' paths stripped, and `export`
// answers a node with an empty list. So this compares *composition* rather than
// drawing — which artboards exist, how many drawings each holds, and what every
// one of them is called, since the importer names each layer `<name> <style>`
// off the sheets. That catches an icon added, removed, renamed, a category
// re-split, a board never imported and a board imported from an older sheet.
//
// It cannot catch a drawing that was redrawn while keeping its name and its
// place. Nothing available here can. Say so rather than implying the file is
// verified: what this proves is that the file holds the right icons, not that it
// holds the right drawings of them.
