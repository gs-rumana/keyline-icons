 * public/logo/logo.svg  ->  app/icon.svg, app/favicon.ico, app/apple-icon.png
 *                       ->  public/logo/icon-192.png, public/logo/icon-512.png
 *                       ->  packages/figma-plugin/icon.png
 *
 * Every one of these is the same mark wearing different constraints, and before
 * this the app icons were three hand-made artifacts with nothing tying them to
 * the logo or to each other. Redraw the mark and they drift silently, because
 * nothing type-checks a favicon.
 *
 * The plugin icon joined them for the same reason and a sharper one: it is
 * uploaded to a Figma Community listing by hand and then lives outside this
 * repository entirely, where no check can ever reach it again.
 *
 *   node pipeline/build-brand.mjs [--check]
 *
 * --check writes nothing and exits non-zero if output would differ. It is
 * deliberately NOT in icons:ci, for the same reason icons:figma is not: it
 * needs something the CI box does not have. Rasterising needs a browser, and
 * two Chrome versions can disagree by a pixel on the same input, so in CI this
 * would fail on the renderer rather than on the mark. Run it after touching
 * the logo, not on every push.
 *
 * No dependencies, per pipeline/README.md — but rasterising a vector is the one
 * thing plain Node cannot do. Rather than take on a native image dependency for
 * three files that change once a year, this shells out to headless Chrome and
 * says exactly what to do when it cannot find one.
