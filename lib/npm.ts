 * How often the set has been downloaded from npm, or `null` when npm will not

 *
 * Summed across all three packages, because the landing page states one fact
 * about the set rather than three about its entry points, and the badge that
 * shows it links to the scope's page, which lists all three.
 *
 * Built the way `repoStars` in `lib/github.ts` is, for the same reasons:
 * server-side so the number is in the HTML at first paint and costs the browser
 * nothing, `revalidate` so the whole site spends a handful of calls an hour
 * rather than one per visit, and never throwing, because a download count is
 * not worth a 500. The landing page already revalidates hourly for the star
 * count in the bar, so this adds no renders.
 *
 * `null` for any failure, including one package of three. A partial sum would
 * be a number that looks right and is quietly low, and the badge simply not
 * rendering is the honest way to say npm did not answer.
